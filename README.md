# Monte carlo simulation

Monte Carlo simulation is a computational technique that uses random sampling to simulate and analyze complex systems. It is used to model the behavior of a system over time by simulating a large number of random outcomes, which can be used to estimate the probabilities of various outcomes occurring.
Monte Carlo simulation is widely used in finance, engineering, physics, and many other fields to model and analyze complex systems that are difficult or impossible to analyze analytically. In finance, Monte Carlo simulation is commonly used to simulate the behavior of stock prices and other financial assets, and to estimate the value of financial derivatives such as options.
The basic idea behind Monte Carlo simulation is to use random sampling to generate a large number of possible outcomes for a given system. Each outcome is generated by randomly selecting values for the system's input variables, based on their probability distributions. These random outcomes are then used to estimate the probability distribution of the system's output variables, which can be used to make predictions about the behavior of the system over time.
The accuracy of a Monte Carlo simulation depends on the number of random samples generated and the quality of the probability distributions used to generate the samples. As the number of samples increases, the accuracy of the simulation generally improves, but at the cost of increased computational time.
